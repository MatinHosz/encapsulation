# encapsulation
This Java project is a simple banking system that uses encapsulation to manage different types of accounts. The main class, BankAccount, stores basic details like account number, account holder name, and balance and includes methods for depositing, withdrawing, and calculating interest.

There are two types of accounts:
Savings Account: Adds 3% interest to the balance.
Transaction Account: Allows overdrafts up to 500 units.

The BankCustomers class keeps track of multiple accounts, and the Main class runs tests for deposits, withdrawals, and interest calculations.
